I’m happy to share that I’ve recently defended my senior thesis and graduated from Caltech with a B.S. in Engineering and Applied Sciences!

A year from now, I look forward to starting my PhD at Princeton University, joining Prof. Jesse Jenkins and the ZERO Lab to conduct energy systems research, with the goal of informing energy and climate policy. During my gap year, I am excited to join <a href="https://brightnightpower.com/">BrightNight</a> to develop industry-leading renewable power solutions as part of the Energy Analytics team.

I’m immensely grateful for the mentorship of Ken Caldeira, Nate Lewis, <a href="https://jadowling.com/">Jackie Dowling</a>, Edgar Virgüez, and many more. Thank you to everyone who guided me throughout my undergraduate journey!
