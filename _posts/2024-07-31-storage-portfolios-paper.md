### Links to Paper and Research Brief

I‚Äôm thrilled to share my first first-author paper, titled ["The Influence of Regional Geophysical Resource Variability on the Value of Single- and Multistorage Technology Portfolios"](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.3c10188), published in ACS Environmental Science & Technology!

In this paper, we explore **the value of single- and multi-storage portfolios** in electricity systems reliant on solar and wind energy.

For a concise 2-page summary, see our [Research Brief](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/650b2a67-8ba1-496b-beab-042f6700f73b/StoragePortfolios_ResearchBrief_16July2024.pdf).

### Key Findings

<ol style="padding-left: 2; margin-top: 20px;">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Long-duration storage may also fulfill short-term power needs</strong>, as long-duration storage already requires substantial discharge power-capacity to meet long-term power needs, such as large demand spikes during weather events.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Among all storage portfolios we analyzed for systems with abundant solar and wind energy, systems deploying <strong>underground hydrogen storage</strong> or <strong>metal-air batteries</strong> had the lowest total system costs, due to being the most cost-effective long-duration energy storage technology. This is because they had the lowest energy-capacity costs out of all storage technologies modeled (~2 $/kWh energy-capacity cost for hydrogen, and 20 $/kWh total cost and 100-h duration for metal-air batteries).</li>

### Methodology

#### Modeling of Different Storage Technologies
<div class="row mt-4">
    <div class="col-sm-7">

        We modeled various low-carbon energy storage technologies currently available on the market:

        <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 2; margin-top: 20px;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> - üîã Lithium-ion batteries</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> - üß™ Redox flow batteries</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> - üí¶ Pumped hydro storage</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> - üèóÔ∏è Gravity energy storage</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> - üî• Thermal energy storage</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> - üí® Compressed air energy storage</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> - ü§ò Metal-air batteries</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> - ‚öóÔ∏è Underground hydrogen energy storage</li>
        </ul>

        In our model, we select base-case costs and round-trip efficiencies from the middle range of estimates from other techno-economic analyses.

I couldn‚Äôt have done this without my collaborators from the [Climate Energy Lab](https://climateenergylab.org/) at the Carnegie Institution for Science, especially my co-first authors ([Edgar Virg√ºez](https://sites.duke.edu/edgarvirguez/) and [Jackie Dowling](https://jadowling.com/)). I started this project during my junior year at Caltech with Jackie, who was my graduate student mentor at the time. I‚Äôve learned and grown so much as a researcher throughout the process, and I want to give an extra special thanks to Jackie for giving me the hands-on and supportive mentorship that I needed to get started in the macro-scale energy modeling world. I also want to thank Edgar Virg√ºez, Ph.D. for putting in countless hours to push this paper through submission and reviews to the finish line.
