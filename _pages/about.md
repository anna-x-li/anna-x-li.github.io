Hi everyone! I'm Anna, an energy systems researcher and incoming PhD student at Princeton University. My research is focused on using optimization-based methods to guide climate and energy policy.

I graduated from Caltech in 2023 with a self-directed major in Engineering and Applied Sciences, in which I studied the chemistry behind energy technologies, as well as quantitative methods that can be applied to model energy systems.

In my undergraduate research at Caltech, I modeled how various portfolios of energy storage technologies may help reduce total costs of an energy system reliant on solar and wind energy.
